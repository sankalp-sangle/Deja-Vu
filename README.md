# Debugger

Debugger is a network visualization web application developed by me as part of my undergraduate thesis <insert report here> at the Systems and Networking lab at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore under the supervision of [Professor Mun Choon Chan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chanmc/past-students.html) and then PhD student [Pravein Govindan Kannan](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-Pravein.Govindan.Kannan). Debugger was created as a way to show the usefulness of SyNDB([https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/kannan](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/kannan)), a tool that uses data-plane programmable switches to record network history and aid root cause detection of faults. All the packet captures present in the traces directory were recorded with SyNDB.

Debugger has been containerized (thank you docker ♥️) and hence is super easy to try out!

Head over to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/sankalp-sangle/FlaskDebugger/wiki) for more information on setup and how you can use it, including a video! If you are a developer, you can also go through the Developer Guide included to get a technical feel of the project. I hope you have fun!
