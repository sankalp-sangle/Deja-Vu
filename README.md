# Debugger

Debugger is a network visualization web application developed by me as part of my undergraduate thesis <insert report here> at the Systems and Networking lab at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore under the supervision of Professor Mun Choon Chan.
  
Head over to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/sankalp-sangle/FlaskDebugger/wiki) for more information on setup and how you can use it, including a video! If you are a developer, you can also go through the Developer Guide included. I hope you have fun!
