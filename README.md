# Debugger

Debugger is a network visualization web application developed by me as part of my undergraduate thesis <insert report here> at the Systems and Networking lab at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore under the supervision of Professor Mun Choon Chan.

Debugger has been containerized (thank you docker!) and hence is super easy to try out!
Head over to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/sankalp-sangle/FlaskDebugger/wiki) for more information on setup and how you can use it, including a video! If you are a developer, you can also go through the Developer Guide included to get a technical feel of the project. I hope you have fun!
